<b>Subspace indexing on Stiefel and Grassman manifolds</b>

a project by Wenqing Hu, Tiefeng Jiang and Li Zhu

(1) Stiefel_Optimization.m 

the object class for optimization calculus and differential geometry on Stiefel manifolds, such as tangent projection, exponential map, geodesics, gradient descent, retraction, logarithmic map, etc.

(2) buildVisualWordList.m

partition a given sample data set according to a tree of given height into leaf nodes

(3) SIFT_PCA.m

do the SIFT (Scale Invariant Feature Transform) PCA analysis

(4) SIFT_PCA_Recovery.m

do the SIFT PCA recovery using the Stiefel_Optimization method, compare with benchmark nearest neighbor method
