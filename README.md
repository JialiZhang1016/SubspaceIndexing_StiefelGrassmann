<b>Subspace indexing on Stiefel and Grassman manifolds</b>

a project by Wenqing Hu, Tiefeng Jiang and Li Zhu

(1) Stiefel_Optimization.m 

contains various functions for optimization calculus and differential geometry on Stiefel manifolds, such as tangent projection, exponential map, geodesics, gradient descent, etc.

(2) buildVisualWordList.m

partition a given SIFT (Scale Invariant Feature Transform) sample data set according to a tree of given height ht

(3) SIFT_PCA.m

do the SIFT PCA analysis
